# Beep Boop Bleep ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris and I'm a software developer. I am also a content creator for https://www.linuxhandbook.com, the command-line focused cousin of the popular tech blog It's FOSS. 

I spend most of my time learning about software. Outside of computers, I enjoy podcasts, watching horror movies, and playing guitar.

## Heat Map
I am always learning and working on new things, but not necessarily on GitHub.
