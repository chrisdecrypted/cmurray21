### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris and I'm a software developer. I am also a content creator for https://www.linuxhandbook.com, the command-line focused cousin of the popular tech blog It's FOSS. 

I spend most of my time writing or learning about software. When I'm not doing that, I enjoy listening to podcasts, watching horror movies, playing guitar, and doing some graphic design stuff.
